# Assignment 1: Write a program in python send a message from client system to server system and vice versa.

* Using the websocket library in Python to establish a simple WebSocket-based communication between a client and a server for sending messages back and forth.

* The server listens on the address "localhost" and port 8765. When a client connects, the server echoes back any messages received from the client.
* You can start the server by running server.py in one terminal and the client by running client.py in another terminal. 
* The client will prompt you to enter a message, and the server will respond with an acknowledgment.
