# Assignment 1: Write a program in python send a message from client system to server system and vice versa.
 
 Simple client-server communication program using sockets in Python. 
 This program allows the client to send a message to the server, and the server will respond back with an acknowledgment message.



The server-client code provided earlier demonstrates a simple example of communication between a server and a client using sockets in Python. Let's break down how the code works:

**Server-side (server.py):**

1. Import the `socket` module: The `socket` module provides the necessary functions and classes to work with sockets, which are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a computer network.

2. Set up server IP and port: Define the server's IP address and port number. The server listens for incoming connections on this IP and port.

3. Create a server socket: Create a socket using the `socket.socket()` function. The `AF_INET` argument specifies the address family (IPv4), and `SOCK_STREAM` indicates that it's a TCP socket.

4. Bind and listen: Bind the socket to the server's IP and port using the `bind()` method. Then, call `listen()` to start listening for incoming connections.

5. Accept client connection: Use the `accept()` method to accept an incoming connection. This call blocks until a client connects. Upon connection, it returns a new socket (`client_socket`) and the client's address (`client_address`).

6. Communication loop: Within an infinite loop, the server continuously receives data from the client using `recv()`, and then decodes the received bytes into a string. If no data is received (indicating the client closed the connection), the loop breaks.

7. Respond to the client: After receiving data, the server prepares a response message and sends it back to the client using the `send()` method.

8. Close the connection: After the communication loop finishes (either due to no data received or the client closes the connection), close the client socket and the server socket.

**Client-side (client.py):**

1. Import the `socket` module: Similar to the server-side, the `socket` module is required to work with sockets.

2. Set up server IP and port: Define the IP address and port number of the server to connect to.

3. Create a client socket: Create a socket using the same specifications as in the server.

4. Connect to the server: Use the `connect()` method to establish a connection to the server using its IP and port.

5. Send data: Prompt the user to enter a message to send to the server. Encode the message to bytes and send it to the server using the `send()` method.

6. Receive response: After sending the message, use the `recv()` method to receive the server's response. Decode the received bytes into a string.

7. Display response: Print the received response from the server.

8. Close the connection: Close the client socket.

In essence, the server waits for incoming connections, receives messages from clients, and responds back to them. The client connects to the server, sends a message, receives the server's response, and then closes the connection. This forms a basic client-server interaction using sockets.
